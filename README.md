## Welcome!

Welcome to the 2023 Qiskit Fall Fest event in UNIUYO! We are thrilled to have all of you here. A team of volunteers from the University of Uyo proudly hosts this event.

The Qiskit Fall Fest is a collection of quantum computing events on college campuses worldwide. Every Fall Fest event is organized and run by the students on each campus, with support from the entire IBM Quantum team. Student leaders work alongside IBM throughout the month of September to design and plan their events, which are then run from October. The events vary from technical hackathons to beginner-friendly challenges, all with the goal of helping to grow the local communityâ€™s skill set.

Our UNIUYO Fall Fest will feature an exciting challenge event commencing on the 21st October. You'll find detailed information about the hackathon and its rules below. The dates for the submission of the challenge notebooks will be announced later and participants stand the chance to earn some IBM-branded swag. Submissions received after this time will regrettably not be considered for judging. Best of luck!
